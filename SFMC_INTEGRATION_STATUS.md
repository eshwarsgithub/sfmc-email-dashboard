# SFMC Integration Status

## ✅ Integration Status: WORKING

Your Salesforce Marketing Cloud (SFMC) integration is **successfully connected** and working properly!

### What's Working:
- ✅ **Authentication**: Successfully connecting to SFMC
- ✅ **API Access**: Can query SFMC endpoints
- ✅ **Dashboard**: Displaying connection status correctly

### Why You're Seeing Demo Data:
The integration is working, but you're currently seeing demo data because:

**No emails have been sent in your SFMC instance yet.** 
- Found: `0 email definitions` in SFMC
- The system is connected but has no real email data to display

### How to See Real Email Data:

1. **Log into Salesforce Marketing Cloud**
2. **Create an Email Campaign:**
   - Go to Email Studio → Content Builder
   - Create a new email template
   - Set up a subscriber list (or import contacts)
   
3. **Send a Test Email:**
   - Use Journey Builder or Email Studio to send emails
   - Even test emails will show up in tracking data
   
4. **Check the Dashboard:**
   - Once emails are sent, the dashboard will automatically display real tracking data
   - Refresh the dashboard to see live updates

### API Endpoints That Work:
- ✅ Authentication endpoint
- ✅ Email definitions endpoint
- ✅ Platform endpoints discovery

### Technical Details:
- **SFMC Subdomain**: `mclxdpbrg2n9j1y8ftm46zszshqy`
- **API Permissions**: Working with current credentials
